My simple work on create in simple spinning cube :>
# How to use 
- Copy or dowload and save it as an c++ source file (.cpp)
  * IMPORTANT : Make sure to installing c++ compiler (i'm using g++ personally), there are lots of way to install it...
- Open cmd or command promt and locate the downloaded (copied) file directory (using cd command for anyone don't know) and compile it (again, I using "g++ YOURFILENAME.cpp -o YOURCUSTOMOUTPUTFILE.exe")
- Then simply wait for it to compile and run the exe file it just created
  * NOTE : Maybe you should temporately disable your anti-virus and run the exe as adminstrator mode for better performence. 

CHEER!
